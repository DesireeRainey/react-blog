      			After growing up in 
      			Spokane for 18 years, I 
      			spent 7 years in Bellingham, 
      			Washington. After growing into a 
      			retirement community routine, my partner
      			and I packed up our things and headed to the 
      			Big City! We now reside in South Lake Union 
      			and enjoy partaking on all that the City has
      			to offer.
